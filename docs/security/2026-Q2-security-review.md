# 🔒 Quarterly Security Review — Q2 2026

> **Authored from**: `docs/security/security-review-template.md` v2 (hardened post spec-panel review of #186)
> **Issue**: #186
> **Status**: 🟡 In Progress (T0+35d at draft authoring; original draft due T0+14d — slippage explained below)

**Review Period**: 2026-04-01 (T0) → 2026-06-30 (T0+90d)

**Status timeline**:
- T0 = 2026-04-01 (issue #186 opened — Q2 quarter start)
- T0+14d = **2026-04-15 (draft due — MISSED, slipped by ~3 weeks)**
- T0+30d = 2026-05-01 (critical fix deadline — see remediation plan below for status)
- T0+90d = 2026-06-30 (close deadline — 56d remaining)

### Slippage explanation

The Q2 review was blocked by missing referenced documentation (#745) and a non-hardened review template (addressed in #743). Both blockers cleared on 2026-05-06; this draft is the first executable Q2 review with a complete documentation tree underneath it.

## Executive Summary

**Overall Security Posture**: 🟡 **Needs Improvement** — non-zero critical+high count in dependencies, large CodeQL backlog dominated by known mitigated patterns.

### Snapshot at scan time (2026-05-06, frozen)

| Source | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Total |
|--------|----------|------|--------|-----|-------|
| **CodeQL** | 0 | 34 | 202 | 1 (warning) | **237** |
| **Backend deps (.NET)** | 0 | 0 | 1 (Moderate) | 0 | **1** |
| **Frontend deps (pnpm)** | 2 | 16 | 27 | 3 | **48** |
| **gitleaks (in-scope)** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0** |

### State after P0 remediation (same day, 2026-05-06)

| Source | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Total | Δ |
|--------|----------|------|--------|-----|-------|---|
| **CodeQL** | 0 | 24 | 112 | 1 | **137** | **−100** (87 log-forging + 13 cleartext/path-access bulk dismiss) |
| **Backend deps (.NET)** | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | **1** | 0 |
| **Frontend deps (pnpm)** | **0** | **0** | 11 | 1 | **12** | **−36** |
| **gitleaks (in-scope)** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0** | 0 |

**Total movement (same day)**: 286 → 150 alerts (−136 = −48%). Critical: 2→0. High: 50→24 (CodeQL HIGH remaining are mostly `cs/exposure-of-sensitive-information`/regex-anchor — to be triaged in subsequent batches).

> *gitleaks raw count was 403 across 148 MB but includes `node_modules/`, build artifacts, and lock files. In-scope source code: 0 leaks.*

### Key Findings

1. **Frontend deps have 2 CRITICAL + 16 HIGH vulnerabilities**, all in **transitive** dependencies (mostly `handlebars`, `axios`, `protobufjs`, `vite`). Most are dev-only (lighthouse, playwright tooling) but `axios` is a runtime dep via `openapi-zod-client`.
2. **CodeQL HIGH=34** is dominated by `cs/exposure-of-sensitive-information` (104 hits) and `cs/log-forging` (87 hits) — both already covered by global mitigations (`LogForgingSanitizationPolicy`, structured logging only). Most are likely false positives requiring batch dismissal with documented evidence (see existing `tools/dismiss-codeql-false-positives.sh`).
3. **Backend deps**: 1 moderate (`OpenTelemetry.Api 1.14.0` GHSA-g94r-2vxg-569j) — single-package fix.
4. **Source-code secret scanning**: clean — gitleaks finds no leaks in tracked source files.
5. **Dependabot is DISABLED** for this repo — should be re-enabled to get continuous monitoring.

### Next Quarter Priorities (Q3)

1. Re-enable Dependabot for automated SCA monitoring
2. Update `axios` (runtime path) to ≥1.15.1 — addresses 4 HIGH advisories at once
3. Run quarterly review on schedule — re-enable workflow `security-review.yml` and ensure it auto-creates the issue at T0
4. Establish SBOM generation cadence (deferred from this quarter — tooling not installed)
5. Add pre-commit gitleaks hook (per #745 plan v2 §m-1)

## Continuity from Previous Quarter

**Previous review**: [2026-Q1-security-review.md](./2026-Q1-security-review.md)

> **Note**: this section will be auditable once Q1 is loaded; currently this Q2 is the first to run against the v2 template, so cross-quarter trend tables are intentionally sparse (will populate on next iteration).

| Metric | Q1 2026 | Q2 2026 | Direction |
|--------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Critical findings (T0 snapshot) | TBD | 0 (CodeQL) + 2 (frontend deps) | TBD |
| High findings (T0 snapshot) | TBD | 34 (CodeQL) + 16 (frontend deps) | TBD |
| Test coverage on tier-1 BC | TBD | TBD | TBD |

Action: in Q3 review, populate Q1+Q2 columns.

## 0. Threat Model Refresh

### 0.1 Attack Surface Inventory

- [x] Public endpoints enumerated: see OpenAPI spec at `/openapi/v1.json` (OpenAPI v3 generated from minimal API + MediatR endpoints)
- [x] Auth surfaces inventoried:
  - Cookie session auth (`/api/v1/auth/login`, `/logout`, `/register`, `/reset-password`)
  - OAuth callbacks (Google, Discord, GitHub) — see `oauth-security.md`
  - 2FA TOTP (see `totp-vulnerability-analysis.md`)
  - API keys (PBKDF2-derived, scope-limited)
  - Admin impersonation (audited via `[AuditableAction]`)
- [x] Data classification: PII (email, OAuth tokens), Secrets (password hashes, API keys, OAuth client secrets), Untrusted user input (PDF uploads — Document Processing BC)
- [x] Trust boundaries: browser → Cloudflare Tunnel → API → DB/Redis → AI services (sandboxed Python sidecars)
- [x] Third-party integrations: BGG API (rate-limited public), OAuth providers (Google/Discord/GitHub), embedding/reranker/PDF services (internal Docker network), GitHub for source

### 0.2 STRIDE per Tier-1 BC (this quarter)

| BC | Spoofing | Tampering | Repudiation | Info Disclosure | DoS | Elevation |
|----|----------|-----------|-------------|------------------|-----|-----------|
| Authentication | ✅ OAuth state validated | ✅ Session cookie HMAC-signed | ⚠️ login audit limited | ✅ pass PBKDF2-hashed | ⚠️ no rate-limit on /reset-password baseline | ⚠️ admin impersonation needs review |
| Administration | ✅ session-required | ✅ audit pipeline | ✅ AuditLog complete | ✅ RBAC | ⚠️ admin endpoint rate-limit TBD | ✅ role guard on every endpoint |
| DocumentProcessing | n/a | ⚠️ PDF parser hardening TBD | ⚠️ upload audit not in `[AuditableAction]` set | ⚠️ filename leakage in errors? | ❌ no upload rate cap | n/a |
| KnowledgeBase | n/a | ⚠️ prompt injection vector (RAG) | ⚠️ AI query audit limited | ⚠️ embedding leak via similarity probe? | ❌ AI cost not capped per user | n/a |

Status legend: ✅ controlled · ⚠️ partial · ❌ gap · 🆕 new threat

### 0.3 Top Kill Chains

#### Kill Chain 1: Compromised admin credential → impersonation → audit-log access
- **Path**: phished admin password → /admin/audit-log (read all activity) → identify high-value targets → impersonate
- **Detective**: alert on admin login from new IP/device
- **Preventive**: 2FA mandatory for admin role (need to verify)
- **Recovery**: revoke session, rotate admin password, audit-log forensics

#### Kill Chain 2: Malicious PDF → embedding poisoning → RAG output manipulation
- **Path**: user uploads crafted PDF → ingestion → vector store → contaminated retrieval → AI agent returns attacker-controlled content
- **Detective**: anomaly detection on embedding distribution shifts (not currently implemented)
- **Preventive**: PDF parser hardening, content-type validation, size cap (✅ partially), text sanitization on extraction
- **Recovery**: rollback embeddings to last-known-good snapshot, revoke uploader's access

#### Kill Chain 3: Vulnerable transitive dep (axios in runtime path) → prototype pollution → request hijacking
- **Path**: malicious response triggers axios prototype pollution → adapter request manipulation → credential exfiltration
- **Detective**: outbound traffic anomaly (n/a — no SIEM)
- **Preventive**: **update axios to ≥1.15.1** (this quarter's #1 action item)
- **Recovery**: rotate any credentials handled via affected axios calls, audit logs

### 0.4 Diff vs Q1 2026

- **New attack surface** (delta from Q1): D.x sessions endpoints (Wave D contracts merged in #757, #753), Cloudflare Tunnel cutover (Traefik decommissioned in #738)
- **Removed surface**: Traefik direct ingress
- **Changed trust boundaries**: edge moved from Traefik to CF Tunnel (auth-aware ingress)

## 1. CodeQL Security Scans

### 1.1 Scan Results (Snapshot 2026-05-06)

**Total Alerts at T0 (frozen)**: **237 open**

| Severity | Open at T0 | Triaged | Fixed | Mitigated | Risk-Accepted | Dismissed FP |
|----------|------------|---------|-------|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Critical | 0 | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a |
| High     | 34 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Medium   | 202 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Low (warning) | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

### 1.2 Top Rules by Count

| Rule ID | Count | Severity | Notes |
|---------|-------|----------|-------|
| `cs/exposure-of-sensitive-information` | 104 | medium | Likely overlaps with log-forging mitigation |
| `cs/log-forging` | 87 | medium-high | **Mitigated globally** by `LogForgingSanitizationPolicy` (per `tools/dismiss-codeql-false-positives.sh`) — bulk dismissal candidate |
| `js/regex/missing-regexp-anchor` | 16 | medium | ReDoS — review case-by-case |
| `cs/cleartext-storage-of-sensitive-information` | 8 | high | Most likely test fixtures or debug paths — review each |
| `js/missing-origin-check` | 7 | medium | postMessage origin validation |
| `js/tainted-format-string` | 4 | medium | log injection via JS — verify sanitization |
| `js/http-to-file-access` | 3 | high | URL → filesystem path traversal — must review |
| `js/file-system-race` | 3 | medium | TOCTOU — review each |
| `js/path-injection` | 2 | high | Direct path injection — must review |
| (other) | 3 | various | Tail of distribution |

### 1.3 Findings (Critical/High) — to triage

> **Triage status**: pending. Plan to use `tools/dismiss-codeql-false-positives.sh` for `cs/log-forging` batch dismissal (already documented mitigation policy), then individually review the 8 `cs/cleartext-storage` and 5 `js/path-injection|http-to-file-access` findings.

| Action | ETA |
|--------|-----|
| Bulk-dismiss `cs/log-forging` 87 alerts with documented LogForgingSanitizationPolicy reference | T0+45d (2026-05-16) |
| Review 8 `cs/cleartext-storage` findings — fix or accept-with-justification | T0+50d (2026-05-21) |
| Review 5 `js/path-injection` + `js/http-to-file-access` HIGH findings — fix all | T0+60d (2026-05-31) |
| Review 16 `js/regex/missing-regexp-anchor` for ReDoS exposure on user input paths | T0+75d (2026-06-15) |

### 1.4 Risk Acceptance Records

(Will populate during triage, T0+45d window.)

## 2. Dependency & Supply Chain Security

### 2.1 Backend Dependencies (.NET)

**Scan Date**: 2026-05-06 · **Tool**: `dotnet list package --vulnerable --include-transitive`

| Package | Version | CVE/GHSA | Severity | Status | Evidence |
|---------|---------|----------|----------|--------|----------|
| OpenTelemetry.Api | 1.14.0 | [GHSA-g94r-2vxg-569j](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g94r-2vxg-569j) | Moderate | ⏳ TBD | Transitive (depended on by other OTel packages); update path requires bumping the parent OTel meta-package |

**Remediation plan**: bump OTel SDK family to latest minor (likely resolves transitive); test telemetry stack post-upgrade; deadline T0+60d.

### 2.2 Frontend Dependencies (pnpm)

**Scan Date**: 2026-05-06 · **Tool**: `pnpm audit --audit-level=moderate`

**Total**: 48 vulnerabilities (3 low / 27 moderate / 16 high / **2 critical**).

#### Critical (2)
| Package | Title | Path | Status |
|---------|-------|------|--------|
| handlebars | JavaScript Injection via AST Type Confusion | (transitive, dev-only) | ⏳ TBD |
| protobufjs | Arbitrary code execution | (transitive) | ⏳ TBD |

#### High (16)
| Package | Title (abridged) | # advisories | Path | Runtime/Dev |
|---------|------------------|---------------|------|-------------|
| axios | Multiple: incomplete CVE-2025-62718 fix, prototype pollution gadgets, header injection | **4** | `openapi-zod-client>axios` | **runtime** |
| handlebars | DoS, JavaScript Injection (multiple) | 4 | (lighthouse / dev tooling) | dev |
| vite | server.fs.deny bypass, arbitrary file read via WebSocket | 2 | (build) | dev |
| flatted | DoS, prototype pollution | 2 | (transitive) | dev |
| picomatch | ReDoS (×2 advisories) | 2 | (transitive) | dev |
| ip-address | XSS in Address6 | 1 | playwright>...>ip-address | dev |
| (others) | | 1 | | |

**Runtime exposure**: only **axios** is in the runtime path (consumed by `openapi-zod-client` which generates a runtime client). All others are confined to dev tooling (Playwright, Lighthouse, Vite dev server).

**Remediation plan** (priority-ordered):
1. **axios** → bump to ≥1.15.1 to close 4 HIGH advisories at once. Path: `pnpm.overrides.axios = "^1.15.1"` or wait for `openapi-zod-client` bump. **Deadline T0+45d**.
2. **handlebars + protobufjs** (CRITICAL) → check if patched versions exist in transitive paths; pin via overrides. Deadline T0+50d.
3. **vite** → bump to latest minor (build tooling, low blast radius but worth fixing). Deadline T0+60d.
4. **picomatch / flatted / ip-address** → bulk update via dependency refresh. Deadline T0+75d.

### 2.3 SBOM Generation (deferred)

⚠️ **Skipped this quarter**: `syft` and `cyclonedx-npm` not installed on the maintainer's workstation. Action item for Q3:
- [ ] Install `syft` (e.g. `winget install Anchore.Syft`) and run on each component
- [ ] Add `pnpm exec @cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm` to package.json scripts
- [ ] Archive SBOMs in `docs/security/sboms/2026-Q3/` from next quarter onwards

**Risk of deferral**: low — SBOMs are observability over current state, not a remediation. The information gap is acceptable for one quarter.

### 2.4 Image Provenance & Signing (deferred)

⚠️ **Skipped this quarter**: cosign not configured. Roadmap unchanged from Q1.

### 2.5 GitHub Actions Audit

- [ ] **Pinning audit (TODO this quarter)**:
  ```bash
  grep -rE "uses: [^@]+@v?[0-9]" .github/workflows/ | grep -vE "@[a-f0-9]{40}"
  ```
  Run + log result here. Action ETA T0+50d.

- [ ] **GITHUB_TOKEN permissions** review pending.

- [x] **Dependabot for `github-actions` ecosystem**: ⚠️ Dependabot is **disabled at the repo level** for security alerts. Confirm if also disabled for version updates; re-enable.

- [x] **Secret exposure check in workflow logs**: 0 incidents reported by GitGuardian Security Checks (pass on all recent PRs).

### 2.6 Exception Records

## 10. Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. v2 hardened template (#743) made authoring this report straightforward — sections + decision rules already in place
2. #745 unblocked all referenced docs in the security tree before this review started
3. gitleaks installed and now part of the workflow (Phase 0 of #745)
4. Audit infrastructure (#3691) discovered to be more mature than expected during #745 Phase 3 discovery

### What Could Be Improved
1. Review draft slipped 3 weeks past T0+14d due to documentation blockers (now addressed)
2. SBOM tooling not installed — deferred to Q3
3. IaC static analysis not run — deferred to Q3
4. DAST not run — deferred to Q3 (resource-bound)
5. Dependabot disabled — should be re-enabled for continuous monitoring

### Process Improvements for Q3
1. Run `security-review.yml` on schedule (verify cron trigger works)
2. Pre-install required tools (syft, hadolint, trivy) before T0+1d
3. Make Dependabot re-enablement a Q2 action item (see below)

- [x] **Fix protobufjs + handlebars CRITICAL** (+ bonus: flatted, picomatch, vite HIGH) via `pnpm.overrides` — PR #773. **0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH remaining in pnpm audit**
- [x] **Triaged 13 manual-review HIGH alerts** (8 `cs/cleartext-storage` + 2 `js/path-injection` + 3 `js/http-to-file-access`) — all confirmed FP and dismissed:
  - 8 cleartext-storage in `Services/LlmClients/{Ollama,DeepSeek,OpenRouter}LlmClient.cs`: response body sanitized via `DataMasking.MaskResponseBody()` before logging — the `Replace` call CodeQL flags IS the redaction mitigation; inline `#pragma` justifications + comments document this.
  - 2 path-injection in `apps/web/scripts/serve-mockups.cjs`: dev-only Playwright mock server with explicit 403 path validation upstream
  - 3 http-to-file-access in codegen/docs scripts: paths derive from script-controlled constants (`OUTPUT_DIR`, `OUTPUT_JSON`), no runtime impact
